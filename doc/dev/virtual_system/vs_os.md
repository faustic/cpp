## Virtual system version 1: Operating system

### Application of proposed design principles

* Simplicity: not a true operating system, but just a minimum interface between the C++ implementation for the virtual system and the C++ implementation for the host system through a small set of system calls.
* Flexibility: the system calls will be located in very specific points, so changes to the interface will not be difficult to propagate.

### System calls

#### Conventions

Conventions for system calls will be defined at a later time as development goes on.

#### List of system calls

The list of supported system calls will be defined at a later time as development goes on.
