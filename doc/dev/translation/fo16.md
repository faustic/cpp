## Fo16 format

Fo16 is an executable and object file format intended to be used on architectures with 16-bit addresses.

A Fo16 file consists of the following parts:

* File header (22 bytes)
    * `fo16_uuid` (16 bytes): a mark identifying this format.
    * `cpu` (2 bytes): integer represented in big-endian order, identifying the cpu, and also the endianness of the remaining integer values in the file. It may take one of the following values:
        * `0x0000`: virtual system version 1, big endian.
    * `start_section` (2 bytes): the section number of the start section, which must be a code section. For object files, its value must always be 0xffff.
    * `start_offset` (2 bytes): the offset, relative to the first address of code in the start section, where the program must start. For object files, its value must always be 0xffff.

* List of sections: an undetermined number of contiguous sections. The last one must be an EOF section. The platform may add other restrictions to the format.

Each section is composed of a section header and other fields specific to each type of section:

* Section header (10 bytes):
    * `id` (2 bytes): zero-based index of this section in the list of sections. The first section must have `id == 0`, the second one `id == 1`, etc.
    * `type` (2 bytes): the section type, which can be one of the following:
        * Code section type: 0x434f.
        * Relocation section type: 0x524f.
        * End-of-file section type: 0x454f.
    * `size` (2 bytes): size of the section in bytes, including its header. It should be consistent with the requirements for each section type.
    * `pref_start` (2 bytes): indicates the address where the section is expected to be loaded. If it is loaded at this expected address, relocations will be ignored.
    * `relocs` (2 bytes): number of relocations for this section. If it is 0x0000, the section can be loaded at any address with no need of relocations. If it is 0xffff, relocations are forbidden and the section must always be loaded at `pref_start` or fail. For any other value, a relocation section must exist associated to this section.
* Type-specific content:
    * Code:
        * `code_size` (2 bytes) : number of machine code bytes that follow.
        * `code_bytes` (`code_size` bytes): machine code.
    * Relocations: *description pending*.
    * End of file: no additional content after the section header.
