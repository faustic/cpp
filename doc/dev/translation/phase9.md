## Phases of translation

### Phase 9

The **instantiation units** generated in phase 8 plus any required library components are combined and converted into a **program image**.

2. The final representation as an executable file.

### Executable file

The format of the executable file is normally determined by the operating system where its execution is intended. If no executable format is defined for a certain target or if the defined formats are inconvenient to use, we will provide executable formats of our own. For now we are only defining the following formats:
